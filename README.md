OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Interview Questions and Answers
General Questions
1. What is OAuth 2.0, and how does it differ from OAuth 1.0?

Answer: OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their data without sharing their credentials. It is simpler and more flexible than OAuth 1.0, focusing on authorization flows and token-based access. Â  
2. What are the core components of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server?

Answer: The core components of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server are:
Authorization Endpoint: Handles user authorization requests.
Token Endpoint: Issues access tokens and refresh tokens.
Userinfo Endpoint: Provides information about the authenticated user.
3. Explain the authorization code grant flow in OAuth 2.0.

Answer: The authorization code grant flow involves:
The user initiates a request to the resource server.
The resource server redirects the user to the authorization endpoint.
The user authorizes the application.
The authorization server redirects the user back to the resource server with an authorization code.
The resource server exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
The resource server uses the access token to access protected resources.
4. What is the difference between an access token and a refresh token?

Answer: An access token is used to access protected resources. A refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires.
5. How does OIDC build upon OAuth 2.0?

Answer: OIDC adds features like identity information, session management, and standardized claims to OAuth 2.0. It provides a more complete solution for user authentication and authorization.
6. What are the key features of OIDC that are not present in OAuth 2.0?

Answer: OIDC features include:
Identity information: OIDC provides information about the authenticated user, such as their name, email, and profile picture.
Session management: OIDC supports session management, allowing you to track user logins and logouts.
Standardized claims: OIDC defines a set of standardized claims that can be included in tokens.
7. What are the different authentication flows supported by OIDC?

Answer: OIDC supports several authentication flows, including:
Authorization code flow
Implicit flow
Hybrid flow
Client credentials grant
Password grant
Technical Questions
1. How would you implement OAuth 2.0 authorization in a Spring Boot application?

Answer: You can use Spring Security's OAuth 2.0 support to easily integrate OAuth 2.0 into your Spring Boot application.
2. What are the security considerations when using OAuth 2.0?

Answer: Security considerations include:
Token security: Protect access tokens from unauthorized access.
Refresh token management: Implement proper refresh token management to prevent token theft.
CSRF protection: Protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
Client-side security: If using client-side flows, be aware of potential vulnerabilities like JavaScript injection.
3. How can you protect against common OAuth 2.0 attacks like token theft and replay attacks?

Answer: Use HTTPS, secure token storage, and implement measures like token revocation and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).
4. What is the role of a JWT in OIDC?

Answer: A JWT is used to represent the user's identity and claims in OIDC. It contains information about the user, the issuer, and the audience.
5. How would you handle token expiration and renewal in OIDC?

Answer: Implement mechanisms to check for expired access tokens and refresh them using refresh tokens. Set appropriate expiration times for tokens.
6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using OIDC compared to traditional username/password authentication?

Answer: Advantages of OIDC include improved security, simplified user experience, and interoperability. Disadvantages may include increased complexity and potential reliance on third-party providers.
7. How can you integrate OIDC with social login providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub?

Answer: Most social login providers support OIDC. You can integrate them into your application by following their specific instructions and using OIDC libraries or frameworks.
Scenario-Based Questions
1. You're building a web application that needs to allow users to sign in using their Google accounts. How would you implement OIDC for this?

Answer: Use a library or framework that supports Google's OIDC implementation. Configure the necessary settings and handle the OIDC flow to obtain the user's information and access token.
2. Your application needs to grant access to a third-party service on behalf of the user. How would you use OAuth 2.0 to achieve this?

Answer: Use the client credentials grant flow to obtain an access token for your application. Then, use the access token to make requests to the third-party service on behalf of the user.
3. Your API is experiencing performance issues due to excessive token validation. How can you optimize the token validation process?

Answer: Implement caching for validated tokens, use efficient token validation algorithms, and consider using token introspection endpoints provided by your authorization server.
4. You need to implement a hybrid flow for user authentication. How would you do this using OIDC?

Answer: The hybrid flow combines the authorization code and implicit flows. You can use it to obtain both an authorization code and an ID token in a single request.
By preparing for these questions and practicing your responses, you can increase your chances of success in an OAuth 2.0 and OIDC interview.
